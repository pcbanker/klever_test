Hi :technologist:, my name is Pablo Banker and below is a summary of my project and its functionality.
##
In this project, I have created a way for you to vote on your favorite cryptocurrency and also stay updated on its price.
<p>Isn't that cool!</p>
<p>On the voting website, all available cryptocurrencies for voting are displayed. Below the image of each cryptocurrency, there are two options, Upvote or Downvote.</p>
<p></p>
The Upvote functionality allows you to increase the vote count for the chosen cryptocurrency and redirect you to a page where you can view the information about that particular cryptocurrency. 
On the other hand, the Downvote functionality decreases the vote count and also redirects you to the page where you can view the information about the cryptocurrency.
<p>At the end of the page, there is a very interesting option where you can see the list of cryptocurrencies along with their information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
So, are you ready to vote?
